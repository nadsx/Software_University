The Best Music Videos of 2018
In 2018, music videos can still be the most powerful way for an artist to introduce us to their creative world, unveil a new aesthetic, or offer an emotional short story. This year saw newcomers like Tierra Whack and Rosalía astound with their ambitious visions.
Beyoncé, JAY-Z, and Childish Gambino used videos to make bold political statements that instantly went viral. And LCD Soundsystem and Hurray for the Riff Raff gave us beautifully shot and acted mini-movies. These bursts of sound and image are readily accessible, mercifully brief, and, at their best, a lot more fulfilling than mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Here are our 25 favorites from this year.

In Sight Out: Liz Phair
Emerging from the indie-rock boys club of Chicago in the early 1990s, Liz Phair made her name with her 1993 masterpiece Exile in Guyville, a song-by-song response to the Rolling Stones’ Exile on Main Street.
It made her a star. This year, to celebrate Exile in Guyville’s 25th anniversary, Phair’s label Matador released Girly-Sound to Guyville, a collection of the home-recorded tapes that she made leading up to Guyville which offer a detailed look at the process and genius behind a feminist rock classic.
